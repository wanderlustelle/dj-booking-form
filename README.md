# DJ Booking Contact Form

This project is a **responsive HTML form** built to help categorize inquiries and streamline communication as a DJ. The form was created as part of a lesson to test and improve HTML form-building skills within **Front-End Foundations**.

As a DJ, it's super important to know **why** people are reaching out—whether it's for **performance bookings**, **sponsorships**, **collaborations**, or **media inquiries**. This form helps sort emails by purpose, making it easier to decide if they should go directly to me or to my **booking manager** to handle.

## Features
- Collects basic information like **Name**, **Email**, and a **Message**.
- Radio buttons allow people to specify **booking type** (Paid, Barter, Gifted Collaboration).
- Checkbox options for different **opportunities** such as DJ performances, speaking engagements, and brand collaborations.
- Dropdown menu to clarify the type of inquiry (e.g., **Booking Inquiry**, **Sponsorship**, or **General Inquiry**).
- Responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes, including phones, tablets, and desktops.

## Why this is useful
As a DJ managing multiple requests, this form makes it easy to **prioritize** and **categorize** inquiries. Whether someone is reaching out for a paid gig, a sponsorship, or even a speaking opportunity, this form helps me decide whether I need to handle the request myself or delegate it to my booking manager. This way, I can focus on the opportunities that truly matter to my career.

## Lesson Overview: HTML Forms
This form was developed as part of a lesson on **HTML Forms**, which play a critical role in web development by enabling users to submit data. Here’s a snippet from the lesson:

> *"Forms are an important component of many websites. From signing up for a new user account to creating new blog posts, forms show up in many different ways on modern web pages. This project involves building a contact form that includes input fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdown menus, all styled to be responsive across devices."*

## Tech Stack
